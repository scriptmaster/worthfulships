# worthfulships
If you want to buy a ship, buy it. Buy more friendships. if you want to park a ship near a port, so others can follow you, create followers. Build a yatch. Be proud about that. Work on more pride than helping people.

Secondly worth is by work done. Stop using such words it might be at you also. Create 1000s of components, pages, screens for free in public repo?
